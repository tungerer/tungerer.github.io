Hi, I'm a PhD student in Linguistics and English Language at the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/ppls/linguistics-and-english-language">University of Edinburgh</a>. My work focuses on theoretical and experimental approaches to speakers' grammatical knowledge &ndash; in particular, the idea that grammar forms a mental network of interrelated constructions.

In my PhD project (supervised by <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/graeme-trousdale">Graeme Trousdale</a> , <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/nikolas-gisborne">Nik Gisborne</a> and <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/chris-cummins">Chris Cummins</a>), I investigate how psycholinguistic evidence from structural priming can inform cognitive-linguistic models of the grammatical network (e.g., in Construction Grammar). More specifically, my focus is on similarity relations between argument structure constructions, including some phenomena that have been rarely studied with priming, such as the English caused-motion and the resultative construction (see my <a href="https://doi.org/10.1515/cog-2020-0016">recent paper</a>).

Other topics in which I'm interested include:
<ul>
  <li>Theoretical accounts of different network links between constructions (taxonomic 'inheritance' links, syntagmatic links, metaphorical links, etc.), including the difference between 'vertical' and 'horizontal' links (see my talk <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/d1mgc408m0nel49/ICCG11_BoA.pdf?dl=0">here</a>)</li>
  <li>Methodological issues in structural priming (and other types of priming), such as the conditions that give rise to facilitatory and inhibitory priming</li>
  <li>Formal and computational approaches to linguistic networks, including the tools of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science">network science</a></li>
  <li>The concept of linguistic 'extravagance' in synchrony and diachrony (see my <a href="https://doi.org/10.1075/bjl.00058.ung">recent co-authored paper</a>), as illustrated by so-called 'snowclones' (constructions like <i>X is the new Y</i> - see our talk <a href="https://gac2020.ijp.pan.pl/GaC_2020_paper_6.pdf">here</a>)</li>
</ul>
