Hi! Since July 2022, I've been a Horizon postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://psycholinguistics.weebly.com/">Psycholinguistics & Cognition Lab</a> (PI Roberto G. de Almeida) at Concordia University, Montreal. I investigate a variety of aspects related to grammatical representation and processing. Previously, I did my PhD at the University of Edinburgh (2022), where I examined how psycholinguistic evidence from structural priming can inform network models of grammar, especially in cognitive-linguistic frameworks like Construction Grammar. See <a href="https://tungerer.github.io/files/Ungerer-2022-Structural-priming-in-the-grammatical-network.pdf">here</a> for a copy of my thesis and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1515/cog-2020-0016">here</a> for my paper on priming between the English caused-motion and the resultative construction.

Our current projects at the lab include:
<ul>
  <li><b>Argument structure</b>: processing of resultatives (<i>He cut the grass short</i>) vs. depictives (<i>She cut the grass wet</i>)</li>
  <li><b>Grammatical creativity</b>: processing of "coerced" sentences like <i>She sneezed the napkin off the table</i></li>
  <li><b>Implicit arguments</b>: processing of implicit themes (<i>They were eating [ ]</i>) and implicit instruments (<i>She was beating the egg [with a whisk]</i>)</li>
</ul>

Apart from that, I'm interested in:
<ul>
  <li><b>Construction Grammar and cognitive-linguistic theory</b> (see our forthcoming Cambridge Element [<a href="https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/83dvj">preprint</a>])</li>
  <li><b>Priming methodologies</b> and how they can be extended to new phenomena (see my <a href="https://doi.org/10.1515/gcla-2022-0008">paper</a> [<a href="https://tungerer.github.io/files/Ungerer-2022-Extending-structural-priming.pdf">manuscript</a>])</li>
  <li><b>Linguistic networks</b> from a theoretical perspective (see my forthcoming paper [<a href="https://tungerer.github.io/files/Ungerer-forthc-Vertical-and-horizontal-links.pdf">manuscript</a>] about 'vertical' and 'horizontal' links between constructions) and from a formal perspective (see these <a href="https://tungerer.github.io/files/Ungerer-2021-Network-science-methods.pdf">slides</a> on network science methods)</li>
  <li><b>Creativity in language change</b>, captured via the concept of linguistic 'extravagance' (see our <a href="https://doi.org/10.1075/bjl.00058.ung">paper</a>), and applied to 'snowclone' constructions such as <i>X is the new Y</i> (see our <a href="https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/y6a8g">preprint</a>)</li>
</ul>
