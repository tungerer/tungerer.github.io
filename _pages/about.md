Hi! I'm a Horizon postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://psycholinguistics.weebly.com/">Psycholinguistics & Cognition Lab</a> (PI Roberto G. de Almeida) at Concordia University, Montreal. 
In my work, I combine experimental and corpus-based methods to investigate linguistic representation and processing.

Our current projects at the lab include:
<ul>
  <li><b>Argument structure</b>: How do speakers compose meaning in resultatives (<i>He cut the grass short</i>) as opposed to depictives (<i>She cut the grass wet</i>)?</li>
  <li><b>Grammatical creativity</b>: How do speakers comprehend grammatically "coerced" sentences like <i>She sneezed the napkin off the table</i>?</li>
  <li><b>Implicit arguments</b>: To what extent do speakers infer implicit but unpronounced themes (<i>They were eating [dinner]</i>) and instruments (<i>She was beating the egg [with a whisk]</i>)?</li>
</ul>

Previously, I did my PhD at the University of Edinburgh (2022), where I examined how psycholinguistic evidence from structural priming can inform cognitive-linguistic models of grammar as a mental network. Download my <a href="https://tungerer.github.io/files/Ungerer-2022-Structural-priming-in-the-grammatical-network.pdf">thesis</a> (soon to be published) and check out my <a href="https://doi.org/10.1515/cog-2020-0016">paper</a> on priming between the English caused-motion and the resultative construction (<a href="https://tungerer.github.io/files/Ungerer-2021-Using-structural-priming-to-test-links.pdf">author version here</a>).

Apart from that, I'm interested in:
<ul>
  <li><b>Construction Grammar and cognitive-linguistic theory</b>: see our forthcoming Cambridge Element on constructionist approaches (<a href="https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/83dvj">preprint here</a>)</li>
  <li><b>Priming methodologies</b> and how they can be extended to new grammatical constructions: see my <a href="https://doi.org/10.1515/gcla-2022-0008">paper</a> (<a href="https://tungerer.github.io/files/Ungerer-2022-Extending-structural-priming.pdf">download author version</a>)</li>
  <li><b>Linguistic networks</b> from a theoretical and formal perspective: see my forthcoming paper about 'vertical' and 'horizontal' links between constructions (<a href="https://tungerer.github.io/files/Ungerer-forthc-Vertical-and-horizontal-links.pdf">download author version</a>) and these <a href="https://tungerer.github.io/files/Ungerer-2021-Network-science-methods.pdf">slides</a> on network science methods in linguistics</li>
  <li><b>Creativity in language change</b>: see our <a href="https://doi.org/10.1075/bjl.00058.ung">paper</a> on the concept of 'extravagance', and its application to 'snowclone' constructions like <i>X is the new Y</i> in our forthcoming paper (<a href="https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/y6a8g">preprint here</a>)</li>
</ul>
