Hi! From July 2022 onwards, I'll be working as a postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://psycholinguistics.weebly.com/">Psycholinguistics & Cognition Lab</a> (PI Roberto G. de Almeida) at Concordia University, Montreal. Details about our projects will be posted soon.

For my PhD at the University of Edinburgh (supervised by Graeme Trousdale, Nik Gisborne and Chris Cummins), I investigated how psycholinguistic evidence from structural priming can inform cognitive-linguistic models of the grammatical network (e.g., in Construction Grammar). See <a href="https://doi.org/10.1515/cog-2020-0016">here</a> for my recent paper on what priming can tell us about the similarity relation between the English caused-motion and the resultative construction.

Apart from that, I'm interested in:
<ul>
  <li>Theoretical accounts of different network links between constructions (taxonomic 'inheritance' links, syntagmatic links, metaphorical links, etc.), including the difference between 'vertical' and 'horizontal' links (see my talk <a href="https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/conferences/construction-grammars/scientific-program/program/">here</a>)</li>
  <li>Methodological issues in structural priming (and other types of priming), such as the conditions that give rise to facilitatory and inhibitory priming</li>
  <li>Formal and computational approaches to linguistic networks, including the tools of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science">network science</a></li>
  <li>The concept of linguistic 'extravagance' in synchrony and diachrony (see our <a href="https://doi.org/10.1075/bjl.00058.ung">recent paper</a>), as illustrated by so-called 'snowclones' (constructions like <i>X is the new Y</i> - see our preprint <a href="https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/y6a8g">here</a>)</li>
</ul>
